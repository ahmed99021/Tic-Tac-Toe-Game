Tic-Tac-Toe is a timeless game that many of us have enjoyed in our lives. For this project, I set out to create a C program that not only allows you to play this classic game but also introduces a few exciting features to enhance the experience.

Game Modes:
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game offers two distinct modes to cater to different preferences:
1. Multiplayer Mode: In this mode, two players can engage in strategic battles, taking turns to place their marks on the game board.
2. Single Player Mode: For those seeking a challenge, the single-player mode pits you against a clever program that aims to outwit you at every move.
3. Quit of the game mode.

User-Friendly Inputs:
To ensure a seamless gaming experience, the program is designed to accept specific inputs:
1. An option to gracefully exit the game at any point.
2. Commands that allow you to switch between the two available game modes.
3. Intuitive inputs for marking positions on the Tic-Tac-Toe board using the NUMPAD.

Gameplay Operations:
The project encompasses core functionalities that are pivotal to the gaming experience:
1. Detection of winning or draw positions, ensuring that it accurately identifies the victorious player.
2. After a winner is declared, the game provides the option to initiate a new round or conclude the session.

User-Centric Display:
For a user-friendly interface, the project opens with an empty game board and updates it after each player's move. Throughout the game, instructive text guides you, making the experience enjoyable and engaging.
